There are several different source files in this directory that are basically 
just the crumbs from development. The important file is doge.cc, which 
implements mle estimation of the doge from paired inputs files. One of the 
difficulties that occurred during development was obtaining a maximization 
procedure that reliably converged on an answer, and these other files implement
various strategies to get convergence.
